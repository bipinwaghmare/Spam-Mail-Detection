# Spam Mail Detection Project

## Overview

This repository contains three distinct implementations of a **Spam Mail Detection System**, showcasing different levels of complexity and technology. The implementations include:  
1. A **Simple Machine Learning Approach**.  
2. **Spam Detection with NLTK & Bernoulli Naive Bayes** deployed using **Streamlit**.  
3. **Advanced Classification using BERT** for state-of-the-art performance.  

Each implementation is in a separate folder with its own `README.md` file containing detailed information.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Simple Machine Learning Approach
- **Folder**: `simple-way/`
- **Key Features**:
  - Utilizes **CountVectorizer** for text vectorization.
  - Handles class imbalance with **SMOTE**.
  - Models used: Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
- **Performance**:
  - High accuracy (~99%) and balanced precision/recall for both spam and ham messages.
- **Best For**: Quick implementation with minimal resource usage.

### 2. Spam Detection with Naive Bayes and Streamlit
- **Folder**: `streamlit-nltk/`
- **Key Features**:
  - Preprocessing with **NLTK** (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming).
  - **TF-IDF** vectorization for feature extraction.
  - Deploys a **Streamlit Web App** for interactive predictions.
- **Performance**:
  - **Bernoulli Naive Bayes** achieved ~99% accuracy.
- **Best For**: Interactive and user-friendly web application.

### 3. Advanced Email Classification using BERT
- **Folder**: `bert-implementation/`
- **Key Features**:
  - Implements **BERT** for robust feature extraction and classification.
  - Fine-tuned on a spam email dataset.
  - Designed for execution in **Google Colab** with GPU acceleration.
- **Performance**:
  - Achieved ~99% accuracy with excellent recall and precision.
- **Best For**: Advanced applications requiring high accuracy and state-of-the-art NLP.
