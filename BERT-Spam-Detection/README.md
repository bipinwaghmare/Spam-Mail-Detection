# 📧 Email Classification Using BERT  

## 📌 Overview  

This project implements an **Email Classification System** using **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**, a state-of-the-art NLP model. The system classifies emails into predefined categories (e.g., Spam or Ham) by leveraging the power of transformers for text representation and classification.
